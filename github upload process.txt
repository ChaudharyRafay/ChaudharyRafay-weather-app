first go to project folder in vs code
write git status if no initialize than write git init
node_module folder is big so we dont need to add/host this folder in github so we make file in main project folder name:(.gitignore) and simply type those folder names wo want to not host(using this the green color is finish for types folder in file)
now file is untracked position so we need to tracked so write (git add .). indicates for whole project folder/files
now write git commit -m "jo mrzi likho"(if not working simply run following commands
(git config user.name "someone")
(git config user.email "someone@someplace.com")
now again run git commit -m "" now problem solve
now goto github website login and create new repositery
after creating repositery you can see link is generated like this(git remote add origin https://github.com/ChaudharyRafay/Chaudhary-Rafay.git) paste this link in vs code terminal and for check type (git remote) and see origin than its perfect
